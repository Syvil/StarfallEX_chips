lag graph 1.0 by Syvil
This chip measures and displays the difference in the rate of time between the game's relative time and the server's actual time.
How to set up:
  1. Spawn a starfall screen
  2. Place lag_graph/lag_graph_init.txt chip
  3. Link the screen to the chip

Wire I/O
  Inputs:
    Threshold: When wired, will override the default logging threshold of the chip (unit is milliseconds)
    Cutoff: When wired, will override the default upper & lower cutoff of the graph (unit is milliseconds)
    Print: When it receives a non-0 value, the current count of the peak log will be printed to chat
  
  Outputs:
    AveGap: Outputs the average gap between detected peaks in seconds
    AvePeak: Outputs the average intensity of the peaks

Peak log:
  Whenever the value of the graph exceeds the threshold, a new entry is added to the peak log.
  Pressing E on the chip as its owner will save, and then clear the current peak log to data/sf_filedata/lagometerpeaklogs as a json table.
  Entries are a table containing:
    ["time"] = realtime() when the peak occured
    ["intensity"] = intensity of the peak
  This table can be loaded into external programs for analysis, such as excell.

Note: due to the nature of floating point time, the graph will lose precision the longer the server has been up.
